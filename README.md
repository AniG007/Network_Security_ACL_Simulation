# Network_Security_ACL_Simulation
Was tasked to simulate the processing of ACL commands as part of coursework
Utilized Python to read contents (ACL Commands/rules) from a file and write the output (ACL decision) to another file
I was tasked to add comments in the code to explain the flow of the code
